- you need to transform some expression into code and evaluate it
- as you create you own data structure you need to create some composer and decomposer
- but your programming language has no specific syntacsis to solve it
- so you must write a DSL and embed it to your programming language

### ovolution of solving problem
- initial embedding
- tagged initial embedding
- tagless initial embedding

### tagless final
- add you ability to add new methods without recompiling a whole code
